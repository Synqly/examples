No code in this directory should be considered required reading for understanding how to implement Connect UI within an application.

It's only supplementary to the demo itself, and includes things such as controls to alter the Connect UI appearance and behavior, without having to make code changes.

Be advised that code in this directory should not be considered part of the demo.
