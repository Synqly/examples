# Connect UI Example – NextJS Pages Router

The Connect UI example demonstrates how to use the Synqly's Connect UI in a multi-tenant NextJS application. It demonstrates how Connect UI is used to allow end-users to configure their integrations, as well as how to retrieve details about the configured integrations.

For more information about Synqly, please see <https://www.synqly.com>.

This example shows you how to:

- Define multiple tenants in a sample application
- Define integration points that are global to the organization
- Integrate Connect UI with a simple NextJS application

> [!NOTE]
> This example is built using the Radix component library, and NextJS
> application framework. Neither of these are requirements in order to use
> the Connect UI for React library, you may use any component libraries or
> application frameworks you prefer.

> [!TIP]
> Reference documentation for Synqly APIs are available at <https://docs.synqly.com>.
